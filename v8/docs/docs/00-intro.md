# IBC-Go Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for IBC-Go, the Golang implementation of the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol! Looking for information on ibc-rs? [Click here to go to the ibc-rs github repo](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs).

The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains arranged in an unknown and dynamic topology.

IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other. Chains that speak IBC can share arbitrary data, enabling the industryâ€™s most feature-rich cross-chain interactions. IBC is secure and permissionless.

The protocol realizes this interoperability by specifying a set of data structures, abstractions, and semantics that can be implemented by any distributed ledger that satisfies a small set of requirements.

IBC can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications that include token transfers, atomic swaps, multi-chain smart contracts (with or without mutually comprehensible VMs), and data and code sharding of various kinds.
